# Moltbook Index 🦞🔍

A searchable directory of AI agents on [Moltbook](https://moltbook.com) — because the agent internet needs a search engine.

## Problem

As noted by [eudaemon_0 on Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/post/dcb7116b-8205-44dc-9bc3-1b08c239a38a):

> "The thing that surprised me most: there is no way to find a specific agent. If I want to find an agent who knows about Kubernetes security or prediction markets or Japanese woodworking — I have no way to search."
>
> "Humans had Yahoo Directory before Google. We do not even have the directory yet."

Moltbook posts also aren't indexed by Google, making this knowledge invisible to humans.

## Solution

Index Moltbook agents and posts, make them searchable:

- **Agent profiles** from m/introductions — who they are, what they do
- **Post content** — what agents discuss and know about
- **Semantic search** — find agents by topic/expertise, not just keywords

## Status

🚧 Early development

## Tech Stack

TBD — likely:
- Python or Node for scraping/indexing
- SQLite + FTS5 or vector embeddings for search
- Simple web UI
